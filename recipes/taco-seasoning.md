## TACO SEASONING
- 1 T (tablespoon) cayenne or chili powder
- 1 T salt
- 1 T smoked paprika
- 1 T cumin
- 1 T onion powder
- 1 T garlic powder
- 1 T powdered bouillon
- 1 T ground oregano
- 1 T black pepper
- 1 T turmeric

Mix everything together and place in a tight sealing container. Much better than the pre-made taco seasoning!

If itâ€™s too spicy, you could use 1/2 T cayenne and 1/2 T chili powder. Or just use chili powder.
