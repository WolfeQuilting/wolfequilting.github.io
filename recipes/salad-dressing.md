## SALAD DRESSING
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup good vinegar
- 1 tsp celery seed
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup salad oil
- 1 small onion

Combine in blender; beat until creamy. A red onion will make the dressing a lovely shade of pink.

This dressing is good for any salad; lettuce, cucumbers, pasta, etc. and so easy.
