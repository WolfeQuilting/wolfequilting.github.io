## VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP
- Cubed stew beef (with some fat)
- 1 bay leaf
- Pepper corns
- Cubed Potatoes (I like to make 1/4 – 2/3 of them rutabaga)
- Sliced carrots (and celery if desired)
- Cabbage

The amount of ingredients depends on the size of your pot. Seriously,  
make this as big or small as you want. I grew up on this soup and love it!

Boil the bay leaf, pepper corns, stew meat and fat for 2 hours. (Slow boil, not rolling.)  
For a clearer broth, skim the “stuff” off the surface of the soup as it boils.

Add the potatoes, carrots and celery and cook for another 1/2 hour.

Add the cabbage and cook for another 20 minutes. Salt as desired.
