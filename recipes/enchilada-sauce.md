## ENCHILADA SAUCE
- Avocado oil spray
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 2 T chipotle chilis in adobo sauce
- 1-1/2 cups tomato sauce
- 1 tsp hot chili powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 3/4 cup chicken broth
- Salt and pepper as needed

Heat a saucepan, spray with avocado oil and sauté the garlic until just golden.  
Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and let simmer  
for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Makes about 2 cups of sauce.

If it’s too spicy, you could use 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and just 1 tablespoon of adobo.
