## TURKEY TETRAZZINI
- 1 lb. spaghetti, broken in half and cooked very al dente
- 1/4 cup butter
- 8 oz. white mushrooms and 8 oz. portabella mushrooms, quartered/chopped to your liking
- 1/2 tsp salt (less if your turkey is salty from a brine)
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 1 cup white wine
- 1/3 cup flour
- 4 cups turkey or chicken broth
- 8 ounces creamed cheese, cubed
- 3-5 cups left over turkey, diced (or whatever you have)
- 1 can large black olives, finely chopped
- 16 oz. frozen green peas
- 1 lb. bacon, fried and cut up
- 1 cup Mexican cheese, shredded
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs

In a large pan (this makes a LOT) melt the butter over medium-high heat.  
Add the mushrooms, salt and pepper, saut√© for several minutes. Add the garlic  
and let it get to know the mushrooms a bit. Then add the wine and simmer until  
the liquid is reduced by half.

Sprinkle the flour into the mix and stir to make a roux.  
Pour in the broth and stir cooking until slightly thickened.

Reduce the heat to medium low and stir in the cream cheese cubes.  
Once it starts to melt add the turkey, olives, peas, bacon, and other cheeses, stirring to combine.

Add the nearly cooked spaghetti and stir it all together. It should be a little loose,  
if not, add another cup of broth or water. The spaghetti will soak it up in the oven.

Pour the whole thing into a large baking dish and sprinkle the panko over the top.  
Optional: spray the crumbs with avocado oil or olive oil to help them brown up.

Bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes, until the dish is bubbling in the center and the crumbs are brown.  
Depending on how deep your pan is, this could take closer to an hour.
