## ZUCCHINI QUICHE
This is my favorite recipe for yellow zucchini. 

- 1 yellow zucchini, 1/4" slices, then quartered if large
- 4 large shallots, sliced into rings
- optional: cherry tomatoes halved
- 1/2 pint whipping cream
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 whole eggs
- salt, pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste
- 1 packaged pie crust
- 4-6 oz shredded gruyere cheese (or other good cheese)

In a large skillet, saute the zucchini, shallots, and tomatoes until softened and the majority of the water has evaporated. 

In a bowl, whisk the cream, eggs, and spices.  

Press the pie crust into a 9″ pie plates. (Option to brush an egg white over the crust.) Sprinkle a small amount of cheese over the crust. Add the zucchini mixture, draining if needed. Pour the egg mixture over the pie and top with the remianing cheese. 

Bake at 375′ for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.
