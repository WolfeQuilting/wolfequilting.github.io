## My HOT SAUCE
- 1/2 c Sriracha â€“ hot chili sauce
- 1/2 c Franks Hot Sauce
- 2 Tbs Thai Garlic Chili sauce
- 1/2 small bottle Tabasco
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp cayanne pepper
- 1 stick melted butter

I used to make my hot sauce with all of that, then I got lazy.  
Now, I just melt a stick of butter and add Sriracha and whatever  
other hot sauces I have in the fridge until I get to 2 cups of sauce.
