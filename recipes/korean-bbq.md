## KOREAN BBQ
This is my modification of a Korean BBQ recipe that was shared with me.

- 1 cup chili paste (like Sambal Oelee)
- scant 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup Hoisin Sauce
- 2.5 Tbs Chinese cooking wine
- 3 Tbs Soy sauce (or a combination of soy and coconut aminos)
v2 Tbs toasted sesame oil
- 3/4 Tbs fish sauce

I use the stick (immersion) blender to mix it all together. Add more sugar if itâ€™s too hot.
