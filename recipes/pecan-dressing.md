## PECAN DRESSING
- 2 Tbs. coarsely ground pecans

- salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

- 2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine pecans, cayenne, salt, and pepper.  
Cook, stirring constantly, until pecans begin to toast, 4-5 min.; set aside to cool.

In a bowl, whisk together pecans, balsamic vinegar and olive oil until smooth.
