## ORIENTAL WINGS
My family loves this so much I usually double it. It's not only create on wings, but  
noodles as well. 

- 1 cup chopped green onion
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup Sriracha â€“ hot chili sauce
- 1/4 cup oyster sauce
- 1/4 cup dark Asian sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 cloves garlic (~2 tsp), finely chopped garlic

Combine in a pan and simmer to thicken. I also use the stick/immersion blender to get it mixed together.
