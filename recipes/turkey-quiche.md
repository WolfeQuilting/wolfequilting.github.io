## TURKEY QUICHE
This is a modified recipe of my Mom’s modified Quiche recipe from a circa 1970's quiche cookbook.  
Great for the breakfast after Thanksgiving to use up those left over turkey scraps.

- 2 cups half & half
- 2 eggs
- 4 egg yolks
- salt and pepper
- pinch of cayenne and nutmeg
- 2 cups chopped turkey
- 1/2 cup sliced black olives
- 1 packaged pie crust

I learned at least part of the secret to a great quiche is to really whip the eggs and cream.  
I use my immersion blender and get the first 5 ingredients on the list really frothy.  
Then, add the turkey and olives.

You’re probably supposed to pre-cook the pie crust, but I never have.  
Just put the pie crust in the pie dish and pour in the mixture.  
Bake at 375 for 45-50 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.
