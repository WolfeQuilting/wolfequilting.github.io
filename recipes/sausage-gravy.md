## SAUSAGE GRAVY
This is my momâ€™s recipe, this is a hearty breakfast!

- 2 lbs sausage (one hot and one medium)
- 1 onion chopped
- 3 cups warm milk
- 1/2 cup flour
- pepper to taste

Brown sausage, when almost done add onions and finish cooking so onion is soft.

Sprinkle flour over meat and onions and cook for a bit. Slowly add the milk, stiring all the while. Simmer until thickened a bit.
