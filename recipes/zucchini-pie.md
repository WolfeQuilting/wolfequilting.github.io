## ZUCCHINI PIE
This is my favorite recipe for the large zucchini that you find in the garden. It’s a light and amazing side dish. It would be good with some added bacon or ham if you want a main meal.

- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup oil
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 3 cups shredded zucchini
- 1 cup biscuit/baking mix
- 1 cup (4 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
- I use the Cuisinart grating blade and run the onion, zucchini, and cheese through it.  
- Also, I use whatever chunk of cheese I happen to have in the refrigerator,  
- Gruyere and Jarlsberg are wonderful in this recipe.

In a bowl , combine the first four ingredients. Stir in zucchini, biscuit mix, and cheese. Pour into two greased 9″ pie plates. (Or one deep dish round) 

Bake at 350′ for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.
