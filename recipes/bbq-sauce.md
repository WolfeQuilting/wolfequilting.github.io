## BBQ SAUCE
This is my mom's modification of a BBQ weenie recipe from the Hunter (SD) Church cookbook, circa 1960.

- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 cup ketchup
- 2 Tbs Worcestershire sauce
- 1/3 c butter
- 1/3 c cider vinegar
- 1/3 c brown sugar
- 1 1/4 tsp liquid smoke
- 2 tsp dry mustard
- 1 tsp pepper

Combine and simmer for 20 minutes to thicken slightly. We use this on ribs, but it would be good on wings as well.
