## Unique Utility Quilter
One of the things I call myself is a "Unique Quilter". Recently I realized I am also a "Utility Quilter",  
meaning my first priority as a quilter is to make sure the quilt will "hang together" over time.  
Since starting to quilt for others, I have come to understand that most quilters are making  
something for someone they love. Some make quilts just because they love to make them, but most  
people want their quilts to be given, used, and loved. These quilters are not creating a work of art,  
which means that I do not have to stress about perfect quilting. (I tell the folks who want perfect to  
talk to my quilting friends with the computerized systems.) Another reason people ask me to quilt for  
them is because they have discovered a complete or half-completed quilt top from a long time ago that some relative started.

My client’s Grandmother made this top, possibly in the 1940’s, and tucked it away in a closet.  
My client found it and wanted to gift it to her Granddaughter. The top was aged with yellows stains. 
We decided to wait until it was quilted to wash it, because the seams were not perfect. The blocks were  
machine stitched, but the bottom tension was horrible and some of the seams were not closed up. Other  
problems included wavy borders and one end being 1.5 inches wider than the other. Those things are troublesome to long arm quilters.

I am on many Facebook groups for various aspects of quilting and in the long arm groups. I kept seeing  
posts of people sending quilts back to their piecing-owners to be reworked for issues like those that I  
found in this quilt. However, this quilt had history and I worked with the flaws the best I could. The  
original maker did the best she could with what she had, who am I to correct her (or do any less/differently)?

Some folks might think my quilting is a bit "sloppy" with the pink thread running over into the white and vice-versa.  
This is where my utility quilter skills come in and help make sure the top will last another lifetime.  
The quilting over the seams is what closed up holes and reinforced loose seams. Using the same color all  
over would have been an option, but pink would have make the embroidery secondary and white would have  
looked like a picket fence over the rest of the quilt. I wanted to make the embroidery be the star, not the quilting.

I have been quilting for other for a few years now and I have had several quilts that have had some issues.  
I feel accomplished when I can be a utility quilter and work through the issues to make my client's quilts usable.

Here's another example of utility quilting. I loved the look of the Spirograph design, but I noticed  
that in most of the blocks it left one square with no quilting at all. My utility sense said that  
was a bad thing so I added one more round of quilting to connect the points of the Spirograph design and  
stitch down those squares. hopefully that will be enough to make the quilt last many more years.
