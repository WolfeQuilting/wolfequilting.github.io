## Welcome to Wolfe Quilting

What a crazy ride it's been, getting a web site set up...again. 

Life keeps morphing. I guess that's a good thing. Better then being stagnant. 

The current phase of the (stripped down) web site is focused on [recipes](recipes) and a little quilting. 

Enjoy the ride!
